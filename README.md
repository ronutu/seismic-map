# Seismic map of Bucharest website
**How to use**:\
Run the backend script in terminal (node index.js)

**Description**:\
The goal of this project is to showcase the buildings of Bucharest with a high seismic risk. First of all let's \
understand how does the seismic design category(SDC) works in Romania:\
a) **Rs I class (R1)**: Buildings with a high risk of collapse in the design earthquake\
b) **Rs II class (R2)**: Buildings that may suffer major structural degradation, but whose stability is unlikely to be affected\
c) **Rs III class(R3)**: Buildings that may show minor structural degradation without significantly affecting safety\
d) **Rs IV class (R4)**: Constructions expected to have a seismic response similar to that of buildings designed according to current codes

This project shows the buildings with R1 and R2 seismic risk. The website uses the Google Maps API and you can also use the Google Street View option to show exactly how a building with high seismic risk looks like.

The data is taken from AMCCRS (Administratia municipala pentru consolidarea cladirilor cu risc seismic):
